# BREAD FACTORY 

### Project Description

This small project looks at using functions and TDD.
We're also implementing Agile and SCRUM principles.

Topics covered include:
- Functions
- TDD
- Documentation
- Agile
- SCRUM

### Functions

Functions are like people at work. They have ONE JOB!
This makes it easier to test.

#### How do They Work?

1) We need to define them
2) Then call them
3)They run the block that is indented.

Other functionality:
- They can take arguments to be dynamic and alter the output

### Why Functions?

Because it keeps our code DRY:
- Don't
- Repeat
- Yourself

Allowing us to call said function numerous times if needed.
 
### Best Practices

- Naming Convention in python is same as variable
- It does only one job!
- Don't print in functions. Makes it harder for program to use/ test
- Separation of Concerns
    - Helps remove single point of failure incode
    - Makes code more maintainable

### Basis of a Test

A test has known or controlled inputs and expected outputs.
All it is, is an assertion.

Unit test is the testing of one single function.

You give it a known input, and you assert for expected output.

Run it, get True or False.
